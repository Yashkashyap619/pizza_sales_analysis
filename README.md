# üçï Pizza Sales Analysis Project

### ***üìÑ Project Overview***
The Pizza Sales Analysis project is a comprehensive end-to-end data analysis designed to explore sales performance, customer preferences, and operational insights for a pizza business. This project utilizes SQL for data extraction and analysis and Power BI for visualization and dashboard creation. It demonstrates the ability to work with real-world datasets and draw actionable insights for business growth.

# üìä Project Data Source

The project is based on pizza sales data provided in CSV format. The dataset includes the following files:

Orders: Details of each customer order.
Order Details: Itemized breakdown of each order.
Pizzas: Information about each pizza, including its size.
Pizza Types: Details of pizza categories and ingredients.

# üîÑ Workflow and Tools Used
Workflow
### 1. Data Import:
- Uploaded CSV files into MySQL using the Table Import Wizard.

### 2. Data Analysis in SQL:
- Solved 13 insightful queries to analyze sales data, including:
- Total revenue by pizza category and size.
- Top-selling pizza types.
- Orders distributed by hour of the day.
- Average revenue per order and more.
- Used JOINS, CTEs, and Window Functions to perform complex data analysis.
- Created a final SQL query to compile a table with only meaningful insights.

### 3. Data Visualization in Power BI:
- Loaded the cleaned and aggregated data from MySQL to Power BI using ODBC Connector.
- Created an interactive dashboard to visualize:
  Revenue by pizza category and size.
  Hourly order trends.
  Key operational metrics.

# üõ† Tools Used

1. MySQL: For data storage, query execution, and analysis.
2. Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and visualizing key insights.
3. ODBC Connector: For seamless data integration between MySQL and Power BI.
